Emoji Cipher is a Java Spring Boot application for text encryption/decryption. Users could encrypt text in any
language into emoji symbols and decrypt emoji ciphertext back to the readable text. The inspiration of this
project comes from *MarySue Encoder* (https://github.com/atonasting/marysue-encoder).
